Becoming a State Park
Burney Falls was named after Samuel
Burney of South Carolina, who died in the
area in 1859. Several local features came to
be named after Burney.
John and Catherine McArthur arrived in
the 1860s, purchased thousands of acres,
and opened a mercantile store in the area.
Over time, several family farms and the
small settlement of Peck’s Bridge sprang
up along the Pit River near the falls. Early
pioneer Isaac Ray established a shortlived lumber mill above the falls, but the
area was sparsely populated well into the
1900s. The nearby Pioneer Cemetery bears
witness to some of the historic names
associated with this part of California.
In 1917 the newly formed Pacific Gas and
Electric Company (PG&E) began buying up
land and water rights in the area. Alarmed
residents foresaw that PG&E, in the
interests of providing more hydroelectric
power, would dam the Pit River and destroy
Burney Falls. Frank and Scott McArthur,
sons of John and Catherine, purchased
160 acres surrounding the falls; in 1920
they deeded the property to the State,
requesting only that it be named for their
parents. The land officially became a state
park in 1926. The Pit River was eventually
dammed; the Pit 3 dam formed the Lake
Britton reservoir.
Some of the park’s oldest features—
including a historic cabin and Diablo
stone stoves—were built by the Civilian
Conservation Corps prior to World War II.
