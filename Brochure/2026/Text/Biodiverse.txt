WE ARE A BIODIVERSE HAVEN
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
Nestled between the rugged dry Southwest and the
lush wet Pacific Northwest, McArthur-Burney Falls
Memorial State Park is on the eastern edge of a swath
of notable biodiversity. From the coast to near the
Nevada border, this region rivals tropical rainforests in
the variety of animals and plants that thrive here.
The secret lies in its varied elevations and diverse
soil compositions, influenced by the surrounding
mountain ranges. Traveling just a few miles can reveal entirely different rainfall
patterns, weather conditions,
and niches to be filled by the
adaptable.
